lite-router
===========

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/lite-router.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-router)

## Introduction

I needed some simple routing solution for my [rxjs-experiments](https://topheman.github.io/rxjs-experiments/#/router) project (not based on any framework or libraries that provides routers out of the box).
So, I made a micro router, based on [history@2.x.x](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/tree/v2).

The next step was to publish it as an npm package (my main interest being the build workflow to setup on an es6+ code base specific to npm packages with multiples files).

## Install

```shell
npm install lite-router
```

## Use

More advanced example on [rxjs-experiments](https://topheman.github.io/rxjs-experiments/#/router):

* [routes](https://github.com/topheman/rxjs-experiments/blob/master/src/routes.js)
* [router init](https://github.com/topheman/rxjs-experiments/blob/master/src/bootstrap.js)

```js
import router from 'lite-router';

/**
 * Simple handler on route "/home" and any routes (since using the wildcard "*")
 */
const mountHome = () => {
  // code to run on route match
  document.getElementById('home-content').style.display = 'block';
  const unMount = () => {
    // code to run on route leave (you wight wanna clean listeners or others)
    document.getElementById('home-content').style.display = 'none';
  };
  // always return the unMount method
  return unMount;
};

/**
 * Param matching on route "/router/posts/:category/:title/edit"
 * params will contain an object like {category: "foo", title: "bar"}
 *
 * Also using Regexp matching: /^\/router\/user\/([^\/?#]+)\/([^\/?#]+)$/i
 */
const mountParams = ({ location, params, history }) => {
  document.getElementById('params-content').style.display = 'block';
  console.log(location, params, history);
  const unMount = () => {
    document.getElementById('params-content').style.display = 'none';
  };
  return unMount;
}

const routes = [
  { pattern: '/', handler: mountHome },
  { pattern: '/router/posts/:category/:title/edit', handler: mountParams },
  { pattern: /^\/router\/user\/([^\/?#]+)\/([^\/?#]+)$/i, handler: routerHandler },
  { pattern: '/defered-mounting', handler: mountHome, resolve: new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 1000)) } // will mount mountHome handler on /defered-mounting once the resolve promise is resolve
  { pattern: '*' handler: mountHome }
];

const unlisten = router(routes);
```

## Api

#### Import router

```js
import router from lite-router
```

#### Init routes

```js
router(routes)
```

The `routes` array contains objects with the following properties:

* `pattern`: can be:
    * a simple string - ex: `/foo/bar`
    * a string containing matching params (identified with a colon) - ex: `/posts/:category/:title/edit`
        * you will retrieve the matched params in the `params` parameter of the handler
    * a regexp - ex: `/^\/router\/user\/([^\/?#]+)\/([^\/?#]+)$/i`
* `handler`: the function that will mount your view, must return an `unmount` function (to cleanup eventually)
    * signature: `({ location, params, history }) => [Function] unmount`
* resolve: *(optional)* a `Promise`, that when resolved, will let the matched handler mount

## Contributers

#### Install

Install, then eventually, `npm link` the library to use it in local.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/topheman/lite-router.git
cd lite-router
yarn
npm link
npm test
npm run build
```

In your project, just run `npm link lite-router`.

#### Build

* One shot: `npm run build`
* Watch mode: `npm run build:watch`

#### Test

* One shot: `npm test` (will also lint the source code)
* Only unit tests: `npm run jest`
* Watch mode: `npm run jest:watch`

The tests are in the `tests` folder, it is ran via [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).
